### AI Text Processing Portfolio

- [NovelGenerator](https://github.com/KazKozDev/NovelGenerator): Fiction generator using LLM to create complete novels with coherent plots, developed characters, and diverse style.

- [ConText](https://github.com/KazKozDev/ConText): Desktop app for secure, local text translation using Ollama LLMs. It supports language detection, text-to-speech, web scraping, text summarization, and YouTube transcript extraction.

- [BookTranslator](https://github.com/KazKozDev/book-translator): Specialized translation tool for large documents or books. Two-stage approach: Google Translate for initial conversion, then Ollama LLM refinement for literary quality and natural flow.

- Fact Flow: Multi-stage fact-checking system.


### LLM Agent Solutions

- [LLMFlow Search](https://github.com/KazKozDev/llmflow-search): Intelligent research agent with multi-stage architecture (analyzes complex queries, performs deep web searches across multiple sources, and synthesizes comprehensive reports).  

- [LLMFlow Agent](https://github.com/KazKozDev/LLMFlow): An extensible framework for building AI agents based on the GAME (Goals, Actions, Memory, Environment) methodology.

- [MELC](https://github.com/KazKozDev/multi-expert-consensus): Multi-Expert LLM Consensus is a distributed multi-agent LLM system that achieves reliable outputs through expert consensus and confidence-weighted validation.


### Prompt Engineering

- [Prompt Engineering Studio](https://github.com/KazKozDev/prompt-engineering-studio): Transforms your simple queries into advanced, optimized prompts using cutting-edge prompt engineering techniques.

- [DeepChain Refinement](https://github.com/KazKozDev/deepchain-refinement): Python-based system that automatically applies refinement techniques to LLM and reduces hallucination.

- [NetReflective Reasoning](https://github.com/KazKozDev/net-reflective-reasoning-llm): LLM reasoning method: combining reflexive cueing with real-time web search and multi-stage analysis for more accurate and explainable answers.
