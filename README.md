# Hi, I'm Artem @KazKozDev

👀  **I'm interested in** Ollama, LLM, automation, and building efficient AI solutions  
🌱 **I'm currently learning** Python, machine learning, and advanced prompt engineering techniques

## 💡 Expertise in:
- Prompt engineering optimization for various LLM models
- Chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting strategies
- Building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems
- Fine-tuning and optimizing LLM performance
- Automating workflows with AI integration

## 🛠️ Working with:
- Local LLMs deployment using Ollama
- Python frameworks for AI/ML (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- LangChain and similar frameworks for LLM applications

💞️ **I'm looking to collaborate on** AI and automation projects using Python  
📫 **How to reach me:** KazKozDev@gmail.com  
😄 **Pronouns:** he/him  
⚡ **Fun fact:** I enjoy coding with LLMs and exploring new ways to optimize AI-human interaction
